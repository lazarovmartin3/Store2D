# Store2D
This is a mini game, aiming to show a simple implementation of a store. The player is spawn next to a road which leads to the store.
The functionalities of the store are:
-	Open/close UI menu 
-	Include all items in a list 
-	Buy items from the store
The game also features with inventory, which when opened, shows a list of the current items inside.
When the store is active, it opens the store page and the inventory page at the same time. When an item is bought, it goes to the inventory. From there the player can press “Equip” button and the item is equipped. On the right-hand side, there is an image in real time, showing the player and when an item is equipped, it is visible on the model. When the store is open, from the inventory, the player can select an item and when “Sell” button is pressed, the item is sold to the store and removed from the inventory. The Inventory is working independently from the store. The player can open it, pressing “I” keyboard button. Here, the player can see all items and also equip them. If item is equipped, it is swapped with the current equipped one.
The game also incudes enemies. They are spawned after short time in the game. After each kill, the player receives small amount of gold, which can be used in the store. If the player dies, everything is reset.
No code is re-used from another game/ project. Everything is written specifically for the purpose of the task.
